# Plano-Band-iPhone-App
An informational iPhone app I created in high school for my band program. Seeks to inform members of events, play music recordings, and show off videos of the organization. Although basic, I'm very proud of this project as it is my first delve into learning a new language (outside of AP CS Java) and coding something new I came up with on my own.

## A few quick notes
This project was developed in 2015, so much of the code is out of date and probably won't compile on the newest Xcode and Swift versions. As you might know, Apple constantly updates its IDE and language.

## Acknowledgements
Thank you to Paul Solt and his Intro to Swift course for helping me get off the ground with the language and developing for iPhone. His explanations and demonstraations were invaluable.
